# A Dummy ToDo App

`Warning:` This is an experimental project that I am using to practice my JavaScript abilities.
I do not recommend actually using the application at this time. However, that may change in the future if I so chose to expand upon these concepts.

Credit to Andrew Chalkley and TeamTreeHouse for the foundation of this code. I had followed along the "Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript" course and decided to expand on the app after the conclusion of the course.

The TeamTreeHouse course for creating the ToDo app did not include any type of storage to save the ToDo tasks. Therefore I decided to test my abilities by adding a local storage feature. I may eventually add AJAX for saving the data to cloud storage.
